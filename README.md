# Pokemon List - React Native Exercise

This project is a React Native application that replicates the Pokemon List page as requested in the Front-end Developer position exercise at IT Consultis. The app is built with TypeScript and uses external libraries for better performance and ease of development.

## Features

-   Well-structured and organized TypeScript-based React Native source code
-   UI implementation that matches the given design
-   API calling using fetch to get Pokemon data
-   Cache supported with @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
-   Skeleton loader for better user experience while loading data
-   Filtering of Pokemon by type

## External Libraries

-   **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage**: AsyncStorage to cache fetched data for faster subsequent loads
-   **lodash**: A utility library that provides useful functions for working with arrays, objects, and other JavaScript data types

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and React Native CLI installed on your machine.
